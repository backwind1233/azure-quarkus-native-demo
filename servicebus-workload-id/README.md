# servicebus-workload-id

This application uses the [Azure Service Bus Extension](https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-azure-services/dev/quarkus-azure-servicebus.html)
of the [Quarkus Azure Services](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-azure-services) to connect to an Azure Service Bus's topic subscription
**authenticating with [Workload Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview?tabs=java)**.

It creates a `ServiceBusProcessorClient` on application startup that logs incoming messages to the console.
The authentication via Workload Identity is provided by the [Azure Identity client library for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity#azure-identity-client-library-for-java),
which is not included directly but by adding the [Azure Identity Extension](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-azure-services/tree/main/common/azure-identity)
module of the [Quarkus Azure Services](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-azure-services).

> The point of this application is to show that it can be compiled to a native image that still functions when deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

The resource setup for this application is complex.
I recommend using the [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configurations in the [../infra](../infra/README.md) directory to create them
so that you have a reproducible setup.

Locally installed tools:
- JDK 21
- Docker for building and pushing the image
- kubectl configured to point to a Kubernetes cluster
- Azure CLI (`az`) for logging in to the Azure Container Registry
- helm for deploying the application to Kubernetes

## Native image

Due to the support provided by the Quarkus Azure Services,
this application can be built as a native image and packaged in a container with

```shell
./mvnw clean package -Dnative -Dquarkus.container-image.build
```

## Running the application

> This description assumes that you are using the reference setup with the Terraform configurations in the
> [../infra](../infra/README.md) directory and that you use the provided helm chart in the [helm](helm) directory.

### Running locally

If you configured user access for yourself in the reference environment,
you can run the application locally with

```
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

### Running in Kubernetes

Set the name of the Azure Container Registry in [config/application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties),
see [config/template.yaml](config/template.properties).

_Log in to the container registry, e.g., Azure Container Registry
(assuming the environment variable `REGISTRY` is set to the name of the registry):_

```shell
az acr login --name $REGISTRY
```

_Build and push the image `$REGISTRY/azure-quarkus-native-demo/servicebus-workload-id:latest`:_
```shell
./mvnw clean package -Dnative -Dquarkus.container-image.build -Dquarkus.container-image.push
```

Configure the deployment, see [helm/config/template.yaml](helm/config/template.yaml).

_Deploy the application in the active kubectl context:_
```shell
helm install servicebus-workload-id helm/servicebus-workload-id --values helm/config/values.yaml
```

_Watch the logs of the pod:_

```shell
kubectl logs --follow deployments/servicebus-workload-id
```

Now you can send a message to the topic subscription with the Service Bus Explorer of the Azure Dashboard
and watch the logs of the Pod to see if the message is received.

_Cleanup: uninstall the Helm release:_

```shell
helm uninstall servicebus-workload-id
```
